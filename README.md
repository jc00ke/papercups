# Papercups

Papercups is an open source live customer chat web app. We offer a hosted
version at [app.papercups.io](https://app.papercups.io/).

You can check out how our chat widget looks and play around with customizing it
on our [demo page](https://app.papercups.io/demo/). The chat widget component
is also open sourced at
[github.com/papercups-io/chat-widget](https://github.com/papercups-io/chat-widget).

_Watch how easy it is to get set up with our Slack integration ðŸš€ :_

## One click Heroku deployment

[![Deploy](https://www.herokucdn.com/deploy/button.svg)](https://heroku.com/deploy?template=https://github.com/papercups-io/papercups)

## Philosophy

We wanted to make a self-hosted version of tools like Intercom and Drift for
companies that have privacy and security concerns about having customer data
going to third party services. Weâ€™re starting with chat right now but we want
to expand into all forms of customer communication like email campaigns and
push notifications.

Stay tuned! We'll be posting a more detailed roadmap soon ðŸ¤“

## Getting started

Papercups runs on Elixir/Phoenix, with a TypeScript React app for the frontend.

- Install [PostgreSQL](https://wiki.postgresql.org/wiki/Detailed_installation_guides)
- Install [asdf](https://asdf-vm.com/#/core-manage-asdf-vm?id=install)
- Install [Erlang dependencies](https://github.com/asdf-vm/asdf-erlang#before-asdf-install)

```
git clone git@github.com:papercups-io/papercups.git
cd papercups
asdf install
mix local.hex
mix deps.get
cd assets && npm install
mix ecto.setup
mix phx.server
```

This will automatically start up the React frontend in watch mode on `localhost:3000`,
with the API running on `localhost:4000`.

The frontend code will start up automatically when you run `mix phx.server`,
but for more information see: [assets/README.md](assets/README.md)

### Developing on Docker

You can edit your local code when developing with docker and it will update in
the container.

_The docker file is made for development only at the moment_

```
docker build -t papercups . && docker-compose up
```

## Running tests

Create a PostgreSQL test database named: `chat_api_test`, and run:

```
mix test
```

## Get in touch

Come say hi to us on
[Slack](https://join.slack.com/t/papercups-io/shared_invite/zt-gfs0d269-dEHm3SYs_5KmFKQ9YhBzDw)
or [Discord](https://discord.gg/Dq2A3eh)! :wave:

# Appendix

(We'll add more instructions here as we implement more integrations.)

## Setting up email alerts

Set the environment variables in the
[`.env.example`](https://github.com/papercups-io/papercups/blob/master/.env.example) file.

At the moment we only support [Mailgun](https://www.mailgun.com/) â€” other
messaging channels are coming soon!

## Deploying

We currently use Heroku for deployments:

```
git push heroku master
heroku run "POOL_SIZE=2 mix ecto.migrate"
```

## Running compiler on file change

_Note_: Make sure you are running this inside of ChatApi otherwise it'll
trigger on UI changes

```
./scripts/compile_watch.sh
```
